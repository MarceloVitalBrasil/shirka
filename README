Shirka interpreter
==================

Shirka is a programming language that does not generate memory garbage: its
runtime does not need a garbage collector to function properly, but the human
does not have to manage memory manually either.

Website: http://hashmal.github.io/shirka/
IRC: `#shirka` channel on `irc.freenode.net`

Features
--------

* Simple, flexible syntax
* Abstraction through operation composition
* Homoiconicity (data is also executable code)
* No memory garbage is ever generated
* MIT License (view the `LICENSE` file)

Installation
------------

If not already done, get the source code:

    git clone git://github.com/hashmal/shirka.git

To compile the interpreter, run the following in the `shirka` directory:

    make

The resulting program can read and execute Shirka files:

    ./shirka FILE

A rudimentary REPL written in Shirka itself lies in the `examples` directory.
