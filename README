    make && make clean

Usage

This section covers the usage of the interpreter but not the language itself.

    ./shirka file.shk

A rudimentary REPL lies in the `examples` directory.

Currently defined intrinsic operations:

    Data execution      ! !?

    Reserve/restore     $=> $-> $<-
                        (canonical form of ->, => and <-)

    Boolean logic       and or not

    Equality testing    =

    Math                + - * / ^ abs > <

    Lists               length cons uncons

    I/O                 print getc

    Meta                $parse
